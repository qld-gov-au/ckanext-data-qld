## Local environment setup
- Make sure that you have latest versions of all required software installed:
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - [Pygmy](https://pygmy.readthedocs.io/)
  - [Ahoy](https://github.com/ahoy-cli/ahoy)
- Make sure that all local web development services are shut down (Apache/Nginx, Mysql, MAMP etc).
- Checkout project repository (in one of the [supported Docker directories](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#access-control)).  
- `pygmy up`
- `ahoy build`

Use `admin`/`password` to login to CKAN.

   restart      Restart all stopped and running Docker containers.
   start        Start existing Docker containers.
   stop         Stop running Docker containers.

   up           Build and start Docker containers.
  ```

## Coding standards
Python code linting uses [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) with configuration captured in `.flake8` file.   

Set `ALLOW_LINT_FAIL=1` in `.env` to allow lint failures.

## Nose tests
`ahoy test-unit`

Set `ALLOW_UNIT_FAIL=1` in `.env` to allow unit test failures.

## Behavioral tests
`ahoy test-bdd`

Set `ALLOW_BDD_FAIL=1` in `.env` to allow BDD test failures.

### How it works
We are using [Behave](https://github.com/behave/behave) BDD _framework_ with additional _step definitions_ provided by [Behaving](https://github.com/ggozad/behaving) library.

Custom steps described in `test/features/steps/steps.py`.

Test scenarios located in `test/features/*.feature` files.

Test environment configuration is located in `test/features/environment.py` and is setup to connect to a remote Chrome
instance running in a separate Docker container. 

During the test, Behaving passes connection information to [Splinter](https://github.com/cobrateam/splinter) which
instantiates WebDriver object and establishes connection with Chrome instance. All further communications with Chrome 
are handled through this driver, but in a developer-friendly way.

For a list of supported step-definitions, see https://github.com/ggozad/behaving#behavingweb-supported-matcherssteps.

## Automated builds (Continuous Integration)
In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. 
Before feature changes can be merged into a shared mainline, a complete build must run and pass all tests on CI server.

This project uses [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) as a CI server: it imports production backups into fully built codebase and runs code linting and tests. When tests pass, a deployment process is triggered for nominated branches (usually, `master` and `develop`).

Add `[skip ci]` to the commit subject to skip CI build. Useful for documentation changes.

### SSH
Circle CI supports shell access to the build for 120 minutes after the build is finished when the build is started with SSH support. Use "Rerun job with SSH" button in Circle CI UI to start build with SSH support.
